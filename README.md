# BambooCollisionFix
"Fix" bamboo collision for Bedrock players by giving bamboo zero server-side collision. This plugin does not require Geyser or Floodgate.

Please read the following warnings before installing this plugin:
- Placement of bamboo may be buggier than usual.
- This plugin is only tested on Java 8. Java 16 will *probably* break.
- Hackers can, theoretically, ignore bamboo and pass through it entirely with this plugin, Java or Bedrock.
